# Programming of AT32UC3C family of microcontrollers and IGLOO nano FPGAs through Bluetooth

This is my master's thesis at Faculty of Information Technology at
Czech Technical University in Prague. It is publicly available in the
[CTU Digital
Library](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/82617?locale-attribute=en). It's
written in English language.

The aim of this masters’s thesis was to develop tools that would allow
writing, reading and verification of a program memory of
microcontrollers of AT32UC3C family, array and FlashROM of IGLOO nano
FPGAs, and its testing. Based on analysis of existing means for a
Bluetooth communication used by the AŽD Praha s.r.o., literature for
AT32UC3C family of microcontrollers, and documentation for the DirectC
reference implementation of FPGA ISP from the Microsemi company tools
for wireless programming has been implemented. The result of the
thesis are tools for writing, reading and verification of a program
memory of microcontrollers of AT32UC3C family, array and FlashROM of
IGLOO nano FPGAs through Bluetooth.

Source codes of the programming tool can be found in attachment of
this thesis.

The wireless programming support is used by [AŽD Praha
s.r.o.](https://www.azd.cz) company for wireless programming and
configuration of its balises.
